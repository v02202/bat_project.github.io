<dt><h3>Climate change</h3></dt>
<dd>Climate change has increasingly threatened ecosystems. Changes in air and land
surface temperatures, extreme climate events, such as droughts and floods, and
climate variability are anticipated to affect different aspects of biodiversity, from
species to community levels (Bellard et al. 2012; Bhattacharjee et al. 2017; IPCC
2019).  Climate variability represents the meteorological condition that differs from the mean condition (Porter and Semenov
2005) in terms of temperature, precipitation, or the interaction of the two. Climate
variability has become more intense in recent years through different climate variables
and temporal scales. For example, changes in precipitation variability may elevate the endangerment of heat and drought sensitive species in cloud forests
(Anderson et al. 2011). In addition to the impact on the species level, communities
could also be affected through changes in species interactions. For instance,
temperature variability may disrupt food chains due to species’ different thermal
tolerance, and thus results in a mismatch of inter-specific relationships (Woodward et
al. 2016). Therefore, as climate variability is projected to change under climate
change (IPCC 2001, 2019), understanding the mechanism how climate variability at
different temporal scales influence community structure is essential for policymakers
to improve the management to avoid the negative impact of climate change on human
life.</dd>

<dt><h3>Community assebly</h3></dt>
<dd>The process that species from the regional area build a local community is called
community assembly, which is determined by species’ dispersal ability, their
responses to the abiotic environment and their interactions with other species
(HilleRisLambers et al. 2012; Kraft and Ackerly 2013). In this process, mechanisms
undergo with the species’ functional traits, which present the response of species or
individual to the environment and the ecological functions provided by (Díaz and
Cabido 2001).</dd>

<ol>
    Dispersal ability determines the potential members in a community,
since only the species who can arrive the location have the opportunity to be a
member of that community (Kraft and Ackerly 2013).
</ol>
<dt id="Environment">Environment</dt>
<ol>
    Environmental factors are known as the environmental filter, preventing those species which cannot tolerate the environment at the location from establishing a viable population. This is one of the
most enduring concepts in the studies of community assembly and is always related to
the traits of species because traits are measured at the individual level and compared
across species (McGill et al. 2006).
</ol>
The tolerance curve of individuals or higher taxonomic groupings defined by an environmental optimum could interpret the
probable trait range (Lynch &amp; Gabriel 1987; Sexton et al. 2017). That is, traits could
play an intermediate role between species and environmental stress for representing a
convergence in ecological function (van der Valk 1981; Keddy 1992; Kraft et al.
2015). For example, in a species‐rich tropical system, the plants whose leaves have
traits associated with high thermal tolerance dominate the hot and dry early-
successional sites, indicating the influence of environmental filtering on the
community structure (Edwin et al. 2010). The general consensus that functional
diversity attributes to community process has been growing (Grime 1997; Chapin et
al. 2000). Functional diversity expresses the value and distribution of species traits in
an ecosystem, thus reflecting many aspects of ecological functions provided by the
species or individual (Dı´az and Cabido 2001, Tilman 2001, Petchey and Gaston
2006). For example, environmental filter is tested in California woody-plant
community based on their traits, and the result indicated that the range of traits is less
than expected from random assembly because of the environmental filter (Cornwell et
al. 2006).

<ol>
    Finally, biotic factors, like competition, may further affect the species
composition of a community. Trait value within the range of a community is
influenced by competition, species with similar traits may have a more intense
competition because of the limited resource (MacArthur and Levins 1967).
</ol>
Multiple functional traits are measured to investigate the species performance in interspecific
competition because phytoplankton in freshwater marine have different functional
constraints on using nitrate and phosphate (Edwards, Klausmeier and Litchman 2011).
Addition to the strong link between ecological process, functional diversity is usually
measured by multiple traits to describe different functions, so functional diversity is
used to understand the subject cannot answered by species diversity (Dı´az and
Cabido 2001; McGill et al. 2006, HilleRisLambers et al. 2012). It is important to
understand the underlying mechanism influencing functional diversity under
temperature variability, yet the current studies is limited and much of them only focus
on the relationship of rising mean temperature and species diversity.</ul></blockquote></p>
